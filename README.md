The Collatz Conjecture
Jarrett Nobles

The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. The conjecture asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into 1.
It is also known as the 3n + 1 problem, the 3n + 1 conjecture
